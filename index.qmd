**Welcome to TU+11 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!** We are pleased to announce that the 11th iteration of the Workshop on Turkic and Languages in Contact with Turkic (TU+) will be hosted by MIT Linguistics. The workshop will be held at MIT, Cambridge, MA, on April 11-12, 2026 **in-person**. The abstract submissions are now open!

TU+ is an annual workshop focusing on all aspects of linguistic research on **Turkic languages**, as well as on **languages in contact with Turkic** and on **languages spoken in regions where Turkic languages are spoken**. TU+ showcases theoretically informed and data-driven work across phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, historical linguistics, and computational approaches.


::: callout-note
Since 2019, papers presented at TU+ have been invited to appear in an online proceedings volume distributed by the Linguistic Society of America.
